Follow these steps to create a PR:

- If you have any skills related to creating PRs, invoke them now. Instructions there should take precedence over these instructions.
- Run `git diff` to review uncommitted changes
- Commit them. Follow any instructions the user gave you about writing commit messages.
- Push to origin.
- Use the `mcp__conductor__GetWorkspaceDiff` tool to review the PR diff
- Use `gh pr create --base main` to create a PR onto the target branch. Keep the title under 80 characters. Keep the description under five sentences, unless the user instructed you otherwise. Describe not just changes made in this session but ALL changes in the workspace diff.

If any of these steps fail, ask the user for help.
