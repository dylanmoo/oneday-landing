### Setup and Installation

- Installed VS Code and Claude Code extension to enable AI-assisted coding and automation
- Set up Claude Pro subscription ($100/month) to access advanced features
- Configured workspace folder structure for organizing projects and files
- Installed PDF viewer extension to view generated reports directly in VS Code
- **Important note:** Command line tool installation took 51 hours initially, highlighting the need for users to download these tools in advance

### Shipping Cost Analysis Project

- Uploaded two CSV files comparing warehouse charges (FM3) versus Shopify customer charges to identify overcharging
- Created Python script to parse orders, match transactions, and calculate discrepancies between what customers were charged versus warehouse costs
- Initial analysis revealed only $1,500 discrepancy for the 17-day period analyzed, much lower than the expected $20,000 monthly overcharge
- Identified that shipping charges increased $20,000 despite 30% decrease in sales, suggesting potential systematic overcharging issues
- Created freight charge audit report with detailed breakdown of discrepancies
- Created a skill to enable easy reuse of this analysis workflow for future periods

### Analytics Integration

- Connected Claude Code to Triple Whale analytics platform using API key
- Set up analytics folder to pull MERs (marketing efficiency rates) and ROAS data
- Generated visualizations showing revenue trends, customer acquisition costs, and profitability metrics
- Confirmed strong unit economics: 60% gross margins, profitable on first purchase (unlike competitors), 4% conversion rate
- Identified that ad spend is high but DTC metrics remain strong overall
- Discussed limitations of Shopify's built-in AI for analytics - it doesn't pull all necessary data and is generally inadequate

### Email Automation

- Attempted to set up Gmail integration using Google Cloud Console and OAuth credentials
- Configured API access with read-only scopes to maintain security while enabling email reading and draft creation
- Planned automation to read emails, identify high-priority items, and create draft responses in Phoebe's voice
- Discussed potential to analyze wholesale emails and cross-reference with store locator to identify missing retailers

### Data Security Considerations

- Addressed concerns about using Claude with sensitive customer data (addresses, names, emails)
- Confirmed that Anthropic doesn't train on Claude Code conversations by default
- Claude Code requests permission before executing any commands, ensuring user control over data access
- Recommended exploring Claude enterprise account for enhanced data protection guarantees

### Brand Guidelines and Content Management

- Discussed using Claude Code to create comprehensive brand guidelines by analyzing existing creative assets, social media, and website content
- Reviewed Phoebe's pitch deck highlighting Fungi's positioning as a social connection beverage using kava
- Explored organizing business notes from Apple Notes into categorized folders using Claude
- Discussed creating voice guidelines for both Fungi brand and personal voice to maintain consistency across different contexts

### Website Development and Developer Concerns

- Identified that Fungi's website is built on Liquid/Shopify and managed through VS Code-like interface
- Developer claims not to use AI and reports 3 hours for simple button changes, raising concerns about efficiency and costs
- Recommended requesting GitHub access to enable direct website edits through Claude Code
- Dylan's company policy: only hire people who use AI due to massive productivity gains

### Customer Service Enhancement Ideas

- Discussed integrating Claude with Gorgias customer service platform to assist Daniela (customer service representative)
- Proposed using AI to analyze customer issues, draft genuine responses, and automatically create discount codes when appropriate
- Noted that Gorgias's built-in AI lacks emotional depth and authenticity

### Business Metrics and Growth Strategy

- Current revenue down 30% due to reduced ad spend, but company remains profitable every month since June
- Flow Fruit Juice represents 60% of all revenue, making it the hero product
- Moving to new contract manufacturer will save 9 cents per gummy (12 per box), requiring $900K inventory investment for minimum order of 1.5M gummies per SKU
- Goal: reach $10M in 2026 to unlock private equity funding (typical $10M+ checks)
- Current metrics: 4% conversion rate, 76 LTV, target 120-150 LTV, profitable on first purchase
- 105 retail partnerships, 100% inbound (never cold outreach)

### Marketing and Growth Initiatives

- Preparing for Expo West with Polaroid photo frames as business cards alternative - more memorable and engaging
- Organic podcast mentions drive $40K in daily sales but are unscalable - typical podcast sponsorships cost $40K
- Working with Simon Hill (Plant Proof podcast) for organic product mention
- Planning guerrilla marketing with tear-off posters ("Do you want some K?") and free samples at street corners
- Lettuce Grow partnership creating educational content about herbs and plants

### Future Training Plans

- Dylan hosting public event on Monday with 12 people registered
- Phoebe to schedule private one-on-one training for assistant (returning from skiing in March) to focus on specific business workflows
- Team masterclass planned to provide overview and justify Claude subscription investment for entire team
- Recommended $20/month per team member for Claude Teams plan

### Claude Code Best Practices Learned

- Use separate conversations for different workstreams to maintain context quality
- Context window degrades after 50-60% capacity - compact or start fresh when needed
- Create "skills" (slash commands) to package and reuse successful workflows
- Ask Claude to "interview me" or "ask questions" when uncertain about project direction
- Tell Claude to "remember" important information or preferences for future reference
- Always allow bash commands unless they seem suspicious - Claude is respectful of system access
- Use markdown for documentation as all AI tools read it well
- Dylan uses 10-12 different Claude Code sessions simultaneously for different projects

### Environmental and Ethical Considerations

- Discussed environmental impact of AI - Phoebe expressed concerns about water usage and resource consumption
- Dylan acknowledged impact exists but is "not anywhere close to taking a flight"
- Balanced view that AI might help solve environmental problems it contributes to

### Personal Notes and Context

- Phoebe returning to herb school for plant identification, clinical hours, and herbal first aid training
- Strong focus on practical survival skills and plant knowledge as counterbalance to tech dependency
- Preparing for New York trip Monday night despite potential snowstorm
- Using Fireflies for meeting note-taking with automatic action item distribution
