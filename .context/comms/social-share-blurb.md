We've been teaching people how to use Claude Code one-on-one, and the reactions have been the same every time — "why didn't I know about this sooner?" So we decided to open it up.

On Monday Feb 23 at 8pm PST, we're hosting a live workshop called **Becoming Superhuman**. In 60 minutes, we'll show you how to use Claude Code — the latest AI tool people are using to 10x their output — to organize your life, automate the busywork, and get hours back in your week.

No coding experience needed. No slides. Just a live walkthrough where you'll build something real you can use the next day.

If you've been curious about AI but didn't know where to start, this is it.
