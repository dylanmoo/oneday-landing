**Voice-to-Text Tools**

A few of you asked about talking to Claude instead of typing. Here are two great options:

- **Wispr Flow** — https://wisprflow.ai/
- **Talktastic** — https://talktastic.com/

**What to do next**

The best thing you can do right now is **keep using Claude Code**. Open your life-os folder, run `/morning-briefing`, and start asking Claude to help with whatever's on your plate today. The more you use it, the more it clicks.

A few ideas to try:
- Ask Claude to connect to your calendar, email, or Notion
- Build a new skill for something you do every week
- Drop a folder of documents in and ask Claude to analyze them
