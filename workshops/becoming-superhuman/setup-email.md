# Pre-Workshop Setup Email

**When to send:** 1-2 days before the workshop (e.g., Sunday afternoon for a Monday evening workshop)

**Subject:** Getting ready for Monday — do this before the workshop (takes ~30 min)

Hey!

We're so excited to have you at **Becoming Superhuman** on Monday at 8 PM PST.

To make sure you can follow along and actually build something during the workshop, we need you to do a few things beforehand. It takes about 30 minutes total, but one of the downloads runs in the background for ~20 minutes, so we recommend **doing this by Monday afternoon (before 5 PM)** — that way if anything comes up, you have time to sort it out before we start.

Here's what to do:

---

**Step 1: Download VS Code** (2 minutes)

This is the free app where Claude Code lives. Think of it like a workspace where you and AI collaborate.

1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Download for macOS
3. Open the downloaded zip file — it'll unpack the app
4. Drag **Visual Studio Code** into your Applications folder
5. Open VS Code once to make sure it launches — you'll see a welcome tab

Here's a quick walkthrough if you want to see it in action: [VS Code setup on Mac (first 1 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA03DODTP5w)

**Step 2: Sign up for Claude** (5 minutes)

You'll need an active Claude subscription to use Claude Code.

1. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and create an account (or sign in if you already have one)
2. Subscribe to **Claude Pro** ($20/month) to get started — this gives you access to Claude Code

If you want higher limits, **Claude Max** ($100/month) is what we'd recommend for daily use. You can start with Pro for the workshop and upgrade later. You can cancel anytime, but you're more likely to want to upgrade to Max after Monday.

---

**Step 3: Install command line tools** (5 min of clicking, ~20 min downloading)

This is the one that takes the longest because it downloads in the background — which is why we're asking you to do it now.

1. Open the app called **Terminal** — search "Terminal" in Spotlight (Cmd + Space), or find it in Applications → Utilities
2. A window with text will appear — don't worry, we'll explain everything about this on Monday
3. Copy and paste this, then press Enter:
   ```
   xcode-select --install
   ```
4. A popup will appear asking you to install developer tools — click **Install**
5. If it asks for your password, enter the password you use to log into your computer
6. Wait for it to finish downloading. Once it says "done" or the progress bar completes, you're good. Close Terminal.

If you've ever installed Xcode tools before, it'll tell you they're already installed — that means you're all set.

**Step 4: Add the Claude Code extension to VS Code** (1 minute)

1. Open VS Code
2. Click the **Extensions** icon in the left sidebar (it looks like four small squares)
3. Search for **"Claude Code"**
4. Click **Install** on the one by Anthropic
5. You'll see a Claude icon appear in the top right of the nav bar — that means it worked

---

**Step 5: Sign into Claude from VS Code** (1 minute)

1. Click the **Claude icon** in the top right of the nav bar to open Claude Code
2. A Claude Code panel will open — it will prompt you to sign in
3. Click **Sign in with Anthropic** — this will open your browser
4. Log in with the same Claude account from Step 2
5. Approve the connection when prompted, then switch back to VS Code
6. You should see Claude Code ready and waiting for your first message

---

**That's everything.** On Monday we'll handle the rest together, live. You don't need to know what any of these tools do yet — that's the whole point of the workshop.

**Quick check that you're ready:**
Open VS Code, click the Claude icon in the top right, and make sure you're signed in. If Claude Code is open and waiting, you're set.

If you hit any snags, just reply to this email and we'll help you out before Monday.

See you there!
